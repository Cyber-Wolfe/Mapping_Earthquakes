# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose

To visualize the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes throughout the world for the past seven days.

## Tasks

This project had been completed with a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website. The geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes from the last seven days were retrieved. That data was then added to a map. All of this data was manipulated and structured through JavaScript and a D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes and put through the Leaflet library to be plotted on a Mapbox map through their API.
